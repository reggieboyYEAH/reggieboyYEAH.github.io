                                        I was assigned in a govt agency IRAS (Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore) and worked on their enterprise system that handles the country's

                                        I used technologies like ASP.NET, C#, IBM DB2, IBM Web Services, SQL Server, Java. The highlight of the project is when we convert the whole enterprise application
                                        from ASP.NET 1.1 to the ASP.NET 4.0, I was in the project for more than 3 years and completing it was such an accomplishment. My biggest project to date.
